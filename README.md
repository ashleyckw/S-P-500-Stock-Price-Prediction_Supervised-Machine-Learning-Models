# S-P-500-Stock-Price-Prediction_Supervised-Machine-Learning-Models
This project focuses on predicting stock prices of S&P 500 companies using supervised machine learning models. It includes time series forecasting using LSTM and stock price analysis with Random Forest and Decision Tree models. The models help forecast stock trends based on historical data.

## Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared historical stock price data for analysis.
* Model Development: Built and trained models using LSTM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms.
* Evaluation: Compared model accuracy using metrics like RMSE and MAE to assess prediction performance.
* Deployment: The final models can be used for predicting future stock prices of selected S&P 500 companies.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow, Keras

## Files
* **A.csv**: Historical stock price data (Dataset) for selected S&P 500 companies like AAPL, ABBV, etc.
* `supervised_learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for building, training, and evaluating the machine learning models (LSTM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree).

## Usage
Run the Notebook: Open and run supervised_learning.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook environment to train and evaluate the models:
`jupyter notebook supervised_learning.ipynb`

## Project Impact
This project enables accurate stock price predictions by utilizing LSTM for time series analysis and Random Forest & Decision Tree for trend analysis, providing critical insights for investment decision-making.
